Build Trigger: Force Vercel to clear cache and rebuild
Timestamp: 2026-02-05 21:14:42
Reason: Resolve cached build error with AlertCircle title attribute
Action: Clear Vercel build cache and redeploy

The local code is correct:
- Line 85 in DeviceTile.tsx uses aria-label (not title)
- All lucide components are properly configured
- No title attributes on lucide components

Vercel is showing cached/stale code. This file forces a fresh build.
